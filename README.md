This C-based Hangman game randomly selects a word for players to guess within a limited number of attempts. With each correct guess, letters are revealed, while incorrect guesses progressively draw a Hangman figure. Players win by correctly guessing the word or lose if too many incorrect attempts are made, all within the console interface.
